Implementation of EvoHDP following the Zhang, Song & al paper :
http://www.shixialiu.com/publications/evohdp/paper.pdf 

All the details and maths comments about the method used are in the notebook. 
The topic weight optimization was done by Cascaded Gibbs Sampling.

The algorithm is quiet expensive because of the optimization technique

The details in the notebook are in French. 

Experiments are done for synthetic data, similary to the paper.
